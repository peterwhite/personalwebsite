      <h3>Nice Things People Have Said</h3>
      <blockquote><p>Peter is a pro and a pleasure to work with. He&#39;s the type of technical go-to person every team needs, always with an eye on the business case. He&#39;s also very easy to speak too and really knows his stuff.</p>  <small>Mike Leigh Cooper - Owner at InkBlot Films</small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>I had the pleasure of working with Peter on TABLE.co&#39;s new marketing website. He did a pixel-perfect job in taking it from design to code in what was a relatively tight timeframe. The website he delivered was fully responsive, fast-loading and even included some nice loading animations that we hadn&#39;t even considered at the design phase. Intelligent, enthusiastic and attentive to his clients, Peter is someone who does exactly what he says he&#39;s going to do and he does it very well</p>
        <small>Noel Lynagh - Founder at Table.co</small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>Peter has always given impeccable, prompt, well thought out support and feedback. In short, he is a rock-star!</p>
        <small>Masad Baba - Attorney</small>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>Peter really helped drive our Agile process on. His liaising withstakeholders and prioritisation of features were crucial to keeping the engineering team delivering things people actually wanted</p>
        <small>Patrick Cherry - Engineering Manager, Raspberry Pi</small>
