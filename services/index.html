    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>I've run, scaled and advised dozens of companies at all stages of their growth.   I'd love to help yours too. Every project is different, but my services usually fit into one (or more) of the categories below:</p>

    <li>  <a href="#web" onClick="document.getElementById('web').scrollIntoView();">Website and eCommerce Development ðŸ–¥</a> </li>
    <li>  <a href="#pm" onClick="document.getElementById('pm').scrollIntoView();">Product Management ðŸ“…</a> </li>

  <h3 id="pm">Product Management</h3>
  <p>Struggling to know where to start with a project? A roadmapping workshop is the perfect starting point. </p>
  <p>
    Roadmapping workshops accelerate development by defining the goals on a project, so we avoidunnecessary work, reduce risks (technical and fiscal) and engage your team.
  </p>
  <p>Iâ€™m an agile practitioner (Certified Scrum Product OwnerÂ®) and have delivered such workshops at companies such as Bytemark, Thomson Reuters and various SMEs across the UK to great success. </p>
  <p>The benefits of roadmapping are:</p>
  <ul style="list-style:disc;">
    <li>The software meets the needs of all stakeholders and has buy-in across the company.
    As users helped to plan the software, your team will be excited to use the software, forgiving of missing features in early versions and very willing to give feedback. </li>
    <li>The software meets your needs and is delivered on budget, as stories can be added/removed to suit your budget. For example, a priority 1 story must be completed, but a priority 3 could be completed later or omitted entirely.  </li>
    <li>The backlog works in â€™sprints' - so each delivered piece of work (typically every 4 weeks) is usable and useful to your business. This allows you to stop/start development as cashflows permits, or add/remove additional developers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I also offer on-going management, to help complicated projects stay on track.</p>
