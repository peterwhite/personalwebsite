<h2>Coming Soon</h2>
<p>Case study to follow</p>

<!--
<p>This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.</p>

<p>We’ve included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.</p>

<div class="image-wrap"><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/yellow-sage.cloudvent.net/compressed/_min_/a96cf527d69f09862655209b9057530c.jpg" alt="" data-cms-original-src="/images/demo/work-01.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Obviously,</strong> we’ve styled up <em>all the basic</em> text formatting options <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">available in markdown</a>.</p>

<p>You can create lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple bulleted lists</li>
  <li>Like this one</li>
  <li>Are cool</li>
</ul>

<p>And:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered lists</li>
  <li>Like this other one</li>
  <li>Are great too</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theme also supports markdown tables:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Author</th>
      <th>Supports tables?</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Duet Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>$49</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Index Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>$49</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Journal Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="video-wrap"><div class="video" style="padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/88357807?color=6c6e95&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>
